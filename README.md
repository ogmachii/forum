# forum
This will be the first web project. A forum. 


I plan to be working on this until the end of the year. I would like this to be self hosted. I would like this to have user accounts and administration accounts. I would like to be able to navigate across different forums. I would like to be able to update different forums. I would like to add forums.

There are probably different things that will be added over time. I've started with 3 seperate pages with their own stylings.
